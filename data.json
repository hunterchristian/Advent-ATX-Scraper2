Food assistance is a vital component in the process of transitioning individuals, families and communities out of chronic hunger and poverty and into self-sufficiency. \"Hunger is the world's biggest solvable problem.\" – World Food Programme. We believe that food is the foundation for all other progress. To a starving child, hope can only truly begin once a reliable source of nutritious food has been established. FMSC produces three special MannaPack™ meal formulas developed by food scientists to specifically stop malnutrition. We believe Jesus Christ has called us to feed the hungry and serve those in need. ·      Feeding children in our community and around the world\r\n·      Partnering with local churches, businesses, schools, civic orgs.\r\n·      Encouraging 1,500+ volunteers to donate 2 hours of their time\r\n·      Packing 270,000 meals; that's enough to feed 740 kids a daily meal for an entire           year! \r\n·      Collecting food to restock the Reveal Resource Center (local community food               bank).Servant leaders enable us to do what we do, every day. We couldn’t do this work without YOU. Servant leaders pack all of the meals that the donations pay for.  It takes both packing and donating to feed the children!",
