Hill Country students and friends will join other churches in amazing worship times at Austin Ridge Bible Church (Bee Cave). Lunch and Dinner on Saturday will also happen at Austin Ridge along with other fun, afternoon activities.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This is an overnight event where students will spend Friday night with a Hill Country small group in host homes. This will give them a chance to hang out with just a few friends and talk about the Bible together. These host homes will be specific to the Hill Country location your student attends (Lakeline or Steiner Ranch). Small groups are based on which small group a student already attends or if you're not in a small group you can request a friend to be with. Anyone is welcome to come - you do not need to already be participating in a small group!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Students will participate in a serving project on Saturday with their small group.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Registration link will open soon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
